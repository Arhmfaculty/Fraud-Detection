# Fraud-Detection Model 

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent transactions based on key features such as Transaction Amount, Transaction Time, Account Age, and Location Change. The model is designed to analyze patterns in transaction behavior and identify anomalies indicative of fraud.

## Key Features
1. **Transaction Amount** - Large transaction amounts often signal potential fraud.
2. **Location Change** - Sudden changes in transaction location can indicate unauthorized activity.
3. **Transaction Time** - Time of the transaction may suggest unusual patterns.
4. **Account Age** - Extremely new or old accounts may impact the legitimacy of transactions.

## Model Performance
While the model demonstrates high accuracy, there is a possibility of overfitting, suggesting it may perform exceptionally well on training data but struggle with unseen data. Further testing with new values indicated that larger Account Age values can also influence fraud detection.

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Feature Engineering** - Incorporate additional features like user behavioral patterns and geographic data to capture more nuanced transaction behaviors.
2. **Advanced Models** - Utilize ensemble methods such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.
3. **Regular Retraining** - Update the model periodically with new data and fine-tune hyperparameters to maintain optimal performance.

## Usage Instructions
1. Prepare the dataset with required features (Transaction Amount, Time, Account Age, and Location Change).
2. Train the model using the provided scripts and evaluate performance metrics.
3. Test the model with unseen data to validate generalization.
4. Apply enhancements like feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning as needed.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Conclusion
This fraud detection model provides a foundation for identifying fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. With ongoing improvements and retraining, it can serve as a robust tool for combating fraud in financial systems.
